            <p>
              Imagine standing in a crude oil pit: noise, gestures, fragments of
              information being yelled across the ring. It looks chaotic, but it
              is not arbitrary. Underneath is a simple structure:
              <em>who trades with whom, in what size, and at what priority</em>.
            </p>

            <h2>Layers of reality</h2>
            <p>
              At the core you have <strong>physical constraints</strong>:
              barrels move on ships, not in nanoseconds. On top of that you have
              <strong>financial abstractions</strong>: futures, options,
              structured products.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we build software around markets, we often invert this and
              start from the abstractions. Frameworks, services, orchestration.
              The first-principles path goes the other way:
            </p>

            <pre><code>while (orders_incoming) {
  normalize();
  prioritize();
  match();
  record();
}</code></pre>

            <h2>Why this matters for systems design</h2>
            <p>
              If you align your architecture with the real stack of the market
              (physical → microstructure → products → UI), you get:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>fewer accidental layers</li>
              <li>clearer failure modes</li>
              <li>
                a UI that reflects actual constraints, not just chart widgets
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              That is why this blog is written in plain HTML. It is not
              nostalgia. It is a reminder: you can always choose the simpler,
              more honest layer to build on.
