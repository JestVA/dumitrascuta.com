              There is nothing inherently wrong with occupying the role of a
              protagonist. In fact, it is often an efficient cognitive posture:
              alignment around a core idea, an institution, or a shared mission
              reduces entropy and simplifies decision-making. In both personal
              trajectories and organizations, this stance can be locally
              optimal. But local payoff does not imply positive expected value
              over time.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Giovanni Drogo pattern, as depicted in The Tartar Steppe by
              Dino Buzzati and later discussed by Nassim Taleb in The Black Swan
              (“Antechamber of Hope”), captures this dynamic precisely. A
              fortified position can serve as a stabilizing structure, one that
              absorbs uncertainty, provides identity, and allows for recovery.
              Yet fortresses are ambiguous assets: they protect, but they also
              delay motion.
            </p>

            <p>
              Such environments often persist through multiple cycles, periods
              of expansion and contraction, optimism and retrenchment while
              maintaining the promise of an eventual inflection point.
              Participants come and go; the structure remains. Maintenance
              replaces progress. Vigilance substitutes for movement. The
              expected breakthrough is always positioned just beyond the
              horizon.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, the convexity changes. What once offered asymmetric
              upside flattens into neutrality. At that point, remaining is no
              longer a bet on opportunity but a bet against variance. The
              fortress has served its function; its continued occupation becomes
              a form of inertia rather than strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Exiting such a structure whether an industry, institution, or role
              rarely comes with clean signals. There is no Kelly-optimal sizing
              for career transitions. The move is underdetermined by data and
              overdetermined by timing. Yet there is a different form of
              leverage at work: exposure to new systems, new people, and new
              constraints. These do not compound linearly, but they expand the
              probability surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The liminal phase that follows: undefined, unlabelled, unstable is
              where variance re-enters the system. Outcomes are no longer
              capped, but neither are they guaranteed. This is the domain where
              information density increases and where genuine novelty becomes
              possible. For better or worse, this is where trajectories bend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortresses are useful. They are not destinations. Stagnation
              begins when protection is mistaken for progress.
